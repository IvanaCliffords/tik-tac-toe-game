## Description 
* A traditional tik tac Toe game; We synchronized state between parent and child components so the board can keep track of each square in the game and each square can keep track of whose turn it is. 



## How to Run
You need to have all the files in your editor, and type "live-server" in your terminal, or open it <a href ="https://ivanacliffords.github.io/tik-tac-toe-game/">here</a>.


## Roadmap of future improvements
I want to add better styling, a reset button, and eventually only allow one click per button.
